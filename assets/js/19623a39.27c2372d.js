How does it work?**Spacescan is a Blockchain Explorer on Chia. Blockchain explorer? At first hearing this term I think anyone will have a series of questions in their mind. What is a blockchain Explorer?\nSpacescan.io is a blockchain expolorer and analytics platform that gives you access to detailed information about all pending or confirmed blockchain transactions, , such as search transaction history, details of a block, current chain height, etc. You can also check the balance or transaction details by wallet address or transaction ID. Spacescan.io is the most trusted tool for exploring all public data on Chia, and it's free to use.\nSpacescan started by three friends as a hobby, later on the interest in the chia explorer developed the organization and the result is now the number one chia explorer.The founders started as a farmer with just 100TB. Once it is grown to 300TB, he realized playing game is not going to have any use in future.The introduction to chia happened through twitter. Firstly, they started on with chia to the moon project.

But now the team is grown quite big, with few interns on board.Now we follow Agile technology of having a meet on every Tuesday-Friday discussing on various aspects on which the members working on.Our design starts with a symbol like xch, dxch that makes us to support main as well as the test net. From Url,node,Tb,etc, everything has a symbol. This is made us to make fork easy for us. Since each section deals with many transactions, charts thereby it needed many level filtration to get a final form. Henceforth, the capacity increased with less time.Our website features dark mode so that it will be feasible for the users.Users can change the view mode from Dark/White through the option given at the top.Our chia chain is different from others as we have a price as well as a netspace with high level of information provided. List of coins and blocks can be viewed on the home page. From the recent coins to xch, cat transactions are differentiation are also shown.Chia main net explorer is kept as main net explorer as it needed to get opened for developer."]})]})}function l(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,n.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,s.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,s.jsx)(d,{...e})}):d(e)}},31006:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{A:()=>i});const i=a.p+"assets/images/BlockSummary-a8320080804cc2ecdc63ea8d8ed78170.png"},21102:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{A:()=>i});const i=a.p+"assets/images/BlockSummary2-0b4da1e6017803d22c91d1e56386cd21.png"},7237:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{A:()=>i});const i=a.p+"assets/images/ChiaPriceGraph-2b8f8b34a8812ad7e24246beb2b3fa02.png"},16081:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{A:()=>i});const i=a.p+"assets/images/DailyXCHperTiB-8d59ad30d0896470c4ad04ae440e1e5a.png"},30467:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{A:()=>i});const i=a.p+"assets/images/HomePageInfo-f6c591aa412b3450735aaf8e8e8f85a4.png"},1015:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{A:()=>i});const i=a.p+"assets/images/Insight-025aa65b380f3e919bf74b5d0192e781.png"},65652:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{A:()=>i});const i=a.p+"assets/images/NetspaceGraph-0c57ae66329d9b43fcaf9c8e22e24204.png"},35764:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{A:()=>i});const i=a.p+"assets/images/Search_function-dc09c9d29dd4bb0ac816e0c87659338b.png"},20348:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{A:()=>i});const i=a.p+"assets/images/Search_function2-7756065756c6eee4fad7723696264c5b.png"},48983:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{A:()=>i});const i=a.p+"assets/images/spacescan-logo-192-08137e25ff58422d2ecb30b3e6074dab.png"},28453:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{R:()=>o,x:()=>r});var i=a(96540);const s={},n=i.createContext(s);function o(e){const t=i.useContext(n);return i.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function r(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(s):e.components||s:o(e.components),i.createElement(n.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
