# Chia Address Profile

We are excited to introduce the new Chia Address profile in Spacescan. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a Chia Address profile using wallet connect. This process will enable the digital identity to be securely managed and shared with others on the Chia community. 

In the near future, this Address profile has the potential to serve as Provence for various assets on the Chia blockchain, as well as a means of verifying social identities across different platforms.

** This feature still in Beta so expect some glitches. [Reach team here for support](https://www.spacescan.io/contact-us) **

### 1) Open Chia Wallet and click on the wallet connect symbol to add connection
