# Chia DID Profile

We are excited to introduce the new Chia DID profile in Spacescan. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a Chia DID profile using wallet connect. This process will enable the digital identity to be securely managed and shared with others on the Chia community. 

In the near future, this DID profile has the potential to serve as Provence for various assets on the Chia blockchain, as well as a means of verifying social identities across different platforms.

** This feature still in Beta so expect some glitches. [Reach team here for support](https://www.spacescan.io/contact-us) **

### 1) Create a DID profile from Chia wallet
