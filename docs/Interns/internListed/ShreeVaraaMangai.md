## My experience in Chia
Chia is well-known to be a secure, easy to use and sustainable blockchain network, outperforming its competitors. Chia is more open and accessible than existing financial institutions, much much more energy efficient than Proof of Work blockchains, better designed for secure smart financial transactions than Ethereum, and more decentralized than Proof of Work and Proof of Stake (POS) chains. Chia digital money (XCH) is more tradeable and compliant across all markets as XCH is a commodity and not an illegal unregistered security in the United States.
   

 
## What I'm expecting in this Intern-2022 PROGRAM
This internship will help me broaden my knowledge in blockchain, crypto currencies, NFTs and get to know more about Reactjs and Nodejs. Apart from these, I'll be getting exposure to Agile Development work flow and get a chance to work together with professional and technical people.
