## About Chia

Chia Network is a blockchain and smart transaction platform that uses proof-of-space and proof-of-time to perform efficient transaction validation, called “farming,” powered by empty computer storage space allocated to “plots.” The idea is to create tokens based on free storage space, rather than processing performance. San Francisco-based Chia, created by BitTorrent founder Bram Cohen and which aims to reduce public blockchains' energy dependency, raised $61 million in a Series D funding round at a valuation of $500 million last year

Many early Bitcoin miners are now multimillionaires. If Chia Coin experienced the same level of growth, then the coins farmed from a 10 terabyte plot would be worth around $2,457 per month instead of $20. Clearly, that's more than enough to justify the cost of hard drive space and farming hardware. Chia is a next-generation, open source blockchain that has been built from the ground up to meet the needs of the future of interconnected markets.
