### Notes
- Each transaction type can be paginated independently
- Dust transactions are excluded by default and must be explicitly requested
- Owned (unspent) coins and spent coins are excluded by default and must be explicitly requested
- Owned coins represent coins where is_spend = false (current balance)
- Spent coins represent coins where is_spend = true (previously owned)
- The response will only include the transaction types that were requested
- Use include_owned=true to get the current balance in individual coins
- Timestamps can be provided as UNIX timestamps (in seconds) using start_timestamp and end_timestamp parameters
